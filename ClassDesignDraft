1. Main Class- might contain methods for parsing input equations and dispatching
them to appropriate solver classes.
2. Linear equations Class - This class handles linear equations of the form ax + b
= 0. It should provide methods to solve single linear equations and systems of
linear equations.
3. Quadratic class - Handles quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
This class should provide methods to solve single quadratic equations and
handle complex roots.
4. Polynomial Class - Handles polynomial equations of degree higher than two.
5. Trigonometric Class
6. Exponential Class- Handles equations involving exponential functions like e^x.
7. Logarithmic Class - Handles equations involving logarithmic functions like
log(x).
